      <h2>CBB Foreign Exchange Authorization</h2>

      <p class="info-text">
        Your <strong>loan withdrawal transfer</strong> request from your profile account 
        to your linked <strong>bank account</strong> requires final clearance by the 
        <strong>Central Bank of Barbados (CBB)</strong>.
        <br><br>
        Under the <strong>Foreign Exchange Control Act</strong>, all outbound transfers
        must be validated with a registered 
        <strong>CBB Foreign Exchange Authorization Code</strong>.
        <br><br>
        This ensures that the transaction complies with both national banking 
        regulations and international fund transfer standards.
        <br><br>
        Please enter your <strong>CBB Authorization Code</strong> below to complete
        your withdrawal and finalize the release of your loan funds.
