      <h2>Tax Clearance Code Verification</h2>

      <p class="info-text">
        Your transaction has passed IMF compliance.  
        Before funds can be released, they must undergo 
        <strong>Tax Clearance Verification</strong> in accordance with the 
        <strong>Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)</strong> and 
        international financial reporting regulations.
        <br><br>
        This ensures your transfer meets global tax standards and is authorized 
        for cross-border settlement.
        <br><br>
        Please enter your <strong>Tax Clearance Code (TCC)</strong> below 
        to proceed with your withdrawal. An incorrect code will delay the release process.
      </p>

        <input type="text" id="taxInput" placeholder="Enter Tax Clearance Code (TCC)" required />
        <button type="submit">Verify</button>
      </form>

          Your transaction is now under tax compliance review.  
          Please wait while the system finalizes the clearance process.  
          Do not close or refresh the page.
